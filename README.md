# Linear Regression from Scratch

This is a simple Python project that implements **linear regression** using **gradient descent**. It predicts a student’s score based on study time.

## Features

- Calculates the best-fitting line (slope `m` and intercept `b`)  
- Shows the Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Visualizes data points and the regression line

## Notes

- Data cleaning is not included; ensure the CSV has no missing or non-numeric values.  
- Learning rate and epochs may need adjustment depending on your dataset.
